Hardware:
Arduino Uno: The microcontroller that controls the LEDs. 
LEDs: Red, yellow, and green LEDs to represent the traffic light colors. 
Resistors: Current-limiting resistors to protect the LEDs from damage. 
Jumper Wires: To connect the components. 
Breadboard (Optional): For prototyping and easy wiring. 
Software (Arduino Code):
Pin Assignments: Define the Arduino pins connected to the LEDs (e.g., red LED to pin 13, yellow to 12, green to 11). 
Sequence Logic: Implement the code to turn the LEDs on and off in a specific sequence (red, yellow, green, and then repeat). 
Timing: Use the delay() function to control the duration of each light state (e.g., red for 5 seconds, yellow for 2 seconds, green for 5 seconds). 
digitalWrite() Function: Use this function to turn the LEDs on or off by setting the pin's state to HIGH (on) or LOW (off).
